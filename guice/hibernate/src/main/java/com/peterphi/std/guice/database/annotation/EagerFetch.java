/**
 * Annotation to be placed on a member within a {@link javax.persistence.Entity}-annotated class to indicate that this should be
 * eager-fetched when querying. This is a replacement for fetch=EAGER on the JPA annotations, because of <a href="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-8776"></a>limitations in Hibernate
 * since 2013</a> that prevent a FetchGraph from overriding fetch=EAGER annotated relations (which means that a user who only wants
 * particular relations expanded must pay a time penalty for the EAGER-annotated relations to be retrieved too)
